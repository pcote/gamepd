<b>So what, exactly is a second run theater for games?</b>
A second run movie theater exists to let people catch a flick that's been around long enough to have completed it's run in the expensive theatres.
This site aims to do the same thing but for video games.  Here's what it all boils down to...
<br /><br />

<b>Cheap Games</b><br />
This site aims for gamers on a budget.
It keeps the games cheap by avoiding PS3 and XBox 360 games that cost more than $49.99
The price ceiling is $39.99 for Wii titles.  
The prices are tracked by the retail list price so there's no confusion about which store sells what for how much.
When a price changes on a title, it comes up to the top of the heap for latest drops.  
<br /><br />

<b>Good Games</b><br />
Quality counts.
Uncle Squirrely attaches game scores based on the trusted reviewers from GamePro magazine.

<br /><br />

<br /><br />

<b>Good Times</b><br />
